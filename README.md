# GildedRoseKata

This repository contains the kata asked Friday 05/10/2018 by email

As Thérèse & me agreed, this is the Kata she asked me to do.

Informations:

to compile, simply clone this repo and open the solution in Visual Studio (was done under VS2017 Pro)

to execute, simply execute the the solution same as every .Net project.

regarding the unit tests, I made some changes in approuvalTest.cs file in order to take in count my changes

Some brief explanations :

Timing : 
  - the whole dll developments and little changes within the existing code took me 2 hours 47 minutes
  - I chose to create a generic DLL as it's reusable as I always do, to givve you an idea on how I develop.
  - Before developing, I have created my own .txt file (VegaCollardKataThirtyDays.txt) in order to validate unit tests of my code.
  - To organize my code, I'm a fan of the #region use, it's simple and allow you to have a well organized code.
  - In order to keep the generic part simple, I chose to use enums because they are easy to change and will directly be taken in count      within my code.

Questions : Should you have some questions for me, please contact me : Vega Collard (vega.collard@gmail.com)

I hope you'll enjoy my code ;-)
